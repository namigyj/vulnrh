## __Very Unsecure__
There are various things I didn't took care of. Others I simply won't be able
to, because of skills or time. 
I plan on gradually securing it though, as I learn more about cryptosystems.

## TODO
* clean up code
* plaintext of any size
* secure it
    * stop using ECB
    * use randomly generated key
    * put the keys in encrypted file (?? is this useful. should I put the key of it in another file ?)
    * use SSL
